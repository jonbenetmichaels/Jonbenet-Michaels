# Jonbenet-Michaels

Hello I am Jonbenet Michaels, a first year Cybersecurity student at Benjamin Franklin Cummings Institute of Technology. This portfolio is specifically to show off coding projects I have been working on in my Fundamentals in Python class and to demonstrate skills that I have learned so that people can see them and maybe give me feedback to help me improve. 

Thank you!
